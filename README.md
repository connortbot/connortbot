<h1 align="center">Hello! ðŸ‘‹</h1>

My name is Connor, and I'm a CS student at UWaterloo.

### Currently
- Core team at [Helicone](https://github.com/Helicone/helicone). Learn more [here](https://www.helicone.ai/)
- Building [Squeak](https://github.com/connortbot/squeak). Check out more [here](https://squeak.today/).

I always want help - reach out :)

### Cool Past Work
- At CalHacks 11.0, my team and I won **Best Use of Vapi** with [LiveStory](https://github.com/pranavbedi/LiveStory)!
- Built the [Caitlyn Renderer](https://github.com/cypraeno/caitlyn).
- To learn some networking, I built [Starbit](https://github.com/connortbot/starbit), a space RTS. You can host it yourself, so grab some friends and give it a try!
- I built a [podcast diarization project](https://github.com/connortbot/podcast-diarizer) to learn about audio clustering in a machine learning pipeline. This is my most *heavily documented* project, feel free to read my writeups!
- Wrote a paper on Principled BSDF models with LUT-based optimization of intermediate functions.
