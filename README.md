<h1 align="center">Hello! ðŸ‘‹</h1>

My name is Connor Loi, and I'm currently studying Computer Science and Business Administration at both UWaterloo and Wilfrid-Laurier!

### Current Work
I'm currently hard at work on two big projects named [GoGo Chess](https://github.com/connortbot/gogo-chess) and, under the Astro-Monkeys RenderTeam, the [Caitlyn Renderer](https://github.com/Astro-Monkeys/caitlyn).
I'm currently working on [GoGo Chess](https://github.com/connortbot/gogo-chess), a MMORPG that you can play inside your very own discord server!
This project is very close to its first official release, so watch or star the repository if you're interested :)

As for the Astro-Monkeys organization, I'm currently exploring the use of **raytracing rendering** to create film-ready visuals for 'pixellax' films. If you're interested, you can view the [repository](https://github.com/Astro-Monkeys/caitlyn)

I'm also a proud speaker of a conlang named 'Sensai'. If you wish to learn more about the language, you can view our website currently being developed.
It has focused lessons and a short history, and is coded entirely with native Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

### Past Work
Unfortunately, much of my past work is copyrighted and private due to software contracting terms. Furthermore, some of them were designed specifically for organizations. You are free to look at my old code!
These include Google Cloud, Google Drive, and Minecraft server management softwares, and an unfinished game called "Astro Impero".
You can also view my arbitrage betting software, [SimplArb](https://github.com/connortbot/simplarb).
