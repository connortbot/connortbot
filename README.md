<h1 align="center">Hello! ðŸ‘‹</h1>

My name is Connor, and I'm currently studying Computer Science and Business Administration at UWaterloo and Wilfrid-Laurier!

### Current Work
I'm currently:
- Building [Squeak](https://github.com/connortbot/squeak). Check out more [here](https://squeak.today/).
- In the Innovation Lab for TD.

I always want help - reach out :)

### Cool Past Work
- At CalHacks 11.0, my team and I won **Best Use of Vapi** with [LiveStory](https://github.com/pranavbedi/LiveStory)!
- As a learning experience I build a local LLM inference engine for TinyLlama called [Solomonoff](https://github.com/connortbot/solomonoff)! I would love to work on it more in the future.
- I built a [podcast diarization project](https://github.com/connortbot/podcast-diarizer) to learn about audio clustering in a machine learning pipeline. This is my most *heavily documented* project, feel free to read my writeups!
- Built the [Caitlyn Renderer](https://github.com/cypraeno/caitlyn).
- Wrote a paper on Principled BSDF models with LUT-based optimization of intermediate functions.
