My name is Connor, and I'm currently studying Computer Science and Business Administration at UWaterloo and Wilfrid-Laurier!

### Current Work
I'm currently...
- Hard at work on the [Caitlyn Renderer](https://github.com/cypraeno/caitlyn).
- Most recently, I have been completing a paper detailing a Principled BSDF model with a LUT-based optimization appraoch.
- Building Solomonoff, a WIP local LLM inference engine for TinyLlama and Cohere models!
