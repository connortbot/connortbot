<h1 align="center">Hello! ðŸ‘‹</h1>

My name is Connor Loi, and I'm currently studying Computer Science and Business Administration at both UWaterloo and Wilfrid-Laurier!

### Current Work
I'm currently hard at work on the [Caitlyn Renderer](https://github.com/cypraeno/caitlyn) under the cypraeno RenderTeam. As a student design team, we primarily focus on upholding industry standard skills of agile development.
We are constantly on recruitment, so feel free to reach out below!

I also am working on Astro Impero, the turn-based space war strategy game for Windows and Mac. It is currently undergoing a overhaul in terms of UI and gameplay style, and you are more than welcome to contribute and check out the game.
[Astro Impero](https://github.com/connortbot/AstroImpero) is open source!

### Past Work
Unfortunately, much of my past work is private due to software contracting terms. Furthermore, some of them were designed specifically for organizations. You are free to look at my old code!
These include Google Cloud, Google Drive, and Minecraft server management softwares, and an unfinished game called "Astro Impero".
You can also view my arbitrage betting software, [SimplArb](https://github.com/connortbot/simplarb).

#### Contact Me!
Employment Inquiries: loiconnor8@gmail.com
Open Source Inquiries: ctloi@uwaterloo.ca or loix2206@mylaurier.ca

I am always looking for help on my projects! If you are simply interested in my work, would like help on your own projects, or want to learn more, please don't hesitate to contact me ðŸ˜„
