<h1 align="center">Hello! ðŸ‘‹</h1>

My name is Connor Loi, and I'm currently studying Computer Science and Business Administration at UWaterloo and Wilfrid-Laurier!

### Current Work
I'm currently hard at work on the [Caitlyn Renderer](https://github.com/cypraeno/caitlyn). Most recently, I have been completing a paper detailing a Principled BSDF model with a LUT-based optimization appraoch. 
I always am wanting help on my personal projects, so feel free to reach out below!

### Past Work
Unfortunately, much of my past work is private due to software contracting terms. Furthermore, some of them were designed specifically for organizations. 
But, you are more than welcome to view the code that is public, such as [GoGo Chess](https://github.com/connortbot/gogo-chess) or [SimplArb](https://github.com/connortbot/simplarb).

I am always looking for help on my projects! If you are simply interested in my work, would like help on your own projects, or want to learn more, please don't hesitate to contact me ðŸ˜„
